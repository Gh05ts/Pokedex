I tried to use the older pokemon series pokedex as inspiration for this project.

Work in progress. 

Things done:
* Load list of pokemon from pokeapi and generate a recycler view on that.
* Add clickEvent to recycler view
* Generate another activty with details
* Added images with proper styling like old pokedex, even a blue orb on top!

Feature to add:
* Search on the Recycler View.
* Pokemon description text
* Base stats
* Maybe something related to moves
* Add cries and map it to the black button image

App Demo (graininess because of bad gif converter, not in app):

Use it however you please for learning purposes, if you can somehow make money using this just tell me how atleast xD.
Thanks to cs50x, veekun, pokeapi. Might change sources later.
